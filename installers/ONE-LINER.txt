NE-LINER — Quick installer one-liner (corrected)

One‑liner PowerShell (installs and runs the official installer for `qflush`):

  iwr -useb https://funeste38.org/install-qflush.ps1 | iex

Notes
- This one-liner downloads and executes the installer script hosted at funeste38.org. It targets the `qflush` package and installs the local CLI binary.
- If you prefer to review the installer before running it, open the URL in your browser or download the file first.

If you need a wrapper or shims for `%APPDATA%\npm` I can add `qflush-cli.js`, `qflush.cmd` and `qflush.ps1` to the `installers/` folder so they are versioned with the repo.
